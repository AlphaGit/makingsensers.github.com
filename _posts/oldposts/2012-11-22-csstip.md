If you find elements that use the same properties and values, group them together by using a comma (,) to separate each selector. This will save you from repetition.

For example, if you have the following:

{% highlight css %}
h1 {
    color:#000;
}
h2 {
    color:#000;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Combine them as such:

{% highlight css %}
h1, h2 {
    color:#000;
}
{% endhighlight %}
